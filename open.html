            A lonely mother gazing out of her window<br />
            Staring at a son that she just can't touch<br />
            If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side But he doesn't<br />
            realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't
            helping<br />
            at all 'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble So,
            he<br />
            goes out and he makes his money the best way he know<br />
            Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't go chasing waterfalls<br />
            Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br />
            I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br />
            But I think you're moving too fast<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation<br />
            But he just can't see<br />
            She give him loving that his body can't handle<br />
            But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me"<br />
            One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror<br />
            But he doesn't recognize his own face<br />
            His health is fading and he doesn't know why<br />
            Three letters took him to his final resting place<br />
            Y'all don't hear me<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't go chasing waterfalls<br />
            Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br />
            I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br />

            I seen rainbow yesterday<br />
            But too many storms have come and gone<br />
            Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray<br />
            Is it because my life is ten shades of gray<br />
            I pray all ten fade away<br />
            Seldom praise Him for the sunny days<br />
            And like his promise is true<br />
            Only my faith can undo<br />
            The many chances I blew<br />
            To bring my life to anew<br />
            Clear blue and unconditional skies<br />
            Have dried the tears from my eyes<br />
            No more lonely cries<br />
            My only bleedin' hope<br />
            Is for the folk who can't cope<br />
            Wit such an endurin' pain<br />
            That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain<br />
            Who's to blame<br />
            For tootin' caine in your own vein<br />
            What a shame<br />
            You shoot and aim for someone else's brain<br />
            You claim the insane<br />
            And name this day in time<br />
            For fallin prey to crime<br />
            I say the system got you victim to your own mind<br />
            Dreams are hopeless aspirations<br />
            In hopes of comin' true<br />
            Believe in yourself<br />
            The rest is up to me and you<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't go chasing waterfalls<br />
            Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to<br />
            I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all<br />
            But I think you're moving too fast<br />
